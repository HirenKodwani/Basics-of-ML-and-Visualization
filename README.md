# Basics-of-ML-and-Visualization
This is a Python file with basics of python all basic libraries and basics of ML with a Amazon Sales Database.  



This repository demonstrates a complete workflow using Python for data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to predict product demand and recommend top-selling products. The dataset used is a real-world **Supermarket Sales** dataset.

 Overview:

This project explores and models supermarket sales data. We clean and preprocess the data, analyze correlations, create time-based features, and build a regression model to predict sales. A **Random Forest Regressor** is then used for product demand forecasting, which powers a basic product recommendation system.
